'' *Handling Equations with x, y, z in FreeBASIC*
'' Let's look at implementing equations involving x, y, z in FreeBASIC.

'' *Example Equation*
'' Consider a linear equation: `2x + 3y - z = 5`

'' *FreeBASIC Implementation*
'' ```
'' freebasic
Dim x As Single = 1.0
Dim y As Single = 2.0
Dim z As Single

' Coefficients
Dim a As Single = 2.0
Dim b As Single = 3.0
Dim c As Single = -1.0
Dim d As Single = 5.0

' Solve for z
z = a*x + b*y - d
Print "z = "; z

' Alternatively, solving for z given the equation 2x + 3y - z = 5
z = a*x + b*y - d
' or
z = 2*x + 3*y - 5
Print "z (for x=1, y=2) = "; z
'' ```

'' *Multiple Equations*
''  For systems of linear equations, you'd typically use methods like substitution or matrix operations.

'' *Example: Solving for z Given x, y*
'' ```
'' freebasic
Sub SolveEquation(x As Single, y As Single, ByRef z As Single)
    z = (x - y*x - x*y) / x
End Sub

SolveEquation x, y, z
Print "Solution z = "; z
'' ```
