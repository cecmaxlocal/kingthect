'' *Creating g5.bi in FreeBASIC*
'' Let's create a `g5.bi` module. Without specific context, I'll provide a general example,
''  perhaps for graphics or game-related functions (G5 could imply a "generation 5" or similar naming).

'' *Possible Purpose*
'' - *Graphics Operations*: Basic drawing, shapes.
'' - *Game Utilities*: Functions useful in game development.

''' *g5.bi Example*
'' ```
'' freebasic
' g5.bi

'' Declare Sub DrawRectangle(ByVal x As Integer, ByVal y As Integer, ByVal w As Integer, ByVal h As Integer)
'' Declare Sub DrawCircle(ByVal x As Integer, ByVal y As Integer, ByVal radius As Integer)
'' ```

'' *Implementation (g5.bas)*
'' ```
'' freebasic
' g5.bas
#include "fbgfx.bi"

ScreenRes 640, 480, 32

Sub DrawRectangle(ByVal x As Integer, ByVal y As Integer, ByVal w As Integer, ByVal h As Integer)
    Line (x, y)-(x + w, y + h), RGB(255, 0, 0), B
End Sub

Sub DrawCircle(ByVal x As Integer, ByVal y As Integer, ByVal radius As Integer)
    Circle (x, y), radius, RGB(0, 0, 255)
End Sub
'' ```

'' *Example Usage (main.bas)*
'' ```
'' freebasic
' main.bas

DrawRectangle(100, 100, 200, 150)
DrawCircle(320, 240, 50)

Sleep
'' ```
'
'' *Considerations*
'' - *Graphics Library*: FreeBASIC's `fbgfx` for graphics.
'' - *Screen Setup*: `ScreenRes` for initializing graphics mode.
'
'' *Questions*
'' - Do you have specific goals for `g5.bi` (graphics, game logic, etc.)?
'' - Are you targeting particular graphics operations or game features?
'' - Would you like help extending or using this module?
