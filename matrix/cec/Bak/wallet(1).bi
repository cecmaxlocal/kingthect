'' *Verifying pupet.bi Macro in FreeBASIC*
'' Let's explore a `pupet.bi` module involving macros in FreeBASIC, focusing on a "self view" concept and letting something "go".

'' *Possible Interpretations*
'' - *Macro Definitions*: `pupet.bi` could contain macros for specific operations.
'' - *"Self View"*: Might imply introspection or showing state.
'' - *"Let Go"*: Could mean releasing resources or resetting state.

'' *Example Macro in FreeBASIC*
'' ```
'' freebasic
' pupet.bi
#Define LetGo(x) x = 0
'' ```

'' *Usage*
'' ```
'' freebasic
' main.bas
#include "pupet.bi"

Dim value As Integer = 5
Print "Before LetGo: "; value
LetGo(value)
Print "After LetGo: "; value
'' ```

'' *Considerations*
'' - *Macros*: Text substitution by preprocessor; can be powerful but require care.
'' - *FreeBASIC Macros*: Use `#Define` for creating macros.

'' *Self-View Example (conceptual)*
'' ```
' freebasic
Type Puppet
    state As String
End Type

#Define SelfView(p) Print "Puppet state: "; p.state

Dim p As Puppet
p.state = "active"
SelfView(p)
