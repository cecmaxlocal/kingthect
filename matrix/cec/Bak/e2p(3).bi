'' *Creating e2p.bi in FreeBASIC*
'' Let's create an `e2p.bi` module, potentially for encoding or conversion-related functions.

'' *Possible Purpose*
'' - *Encoding/Decoding*: Functions for converting data formats.
'' - *Encryption*: Basic cryptographic operations.

'' *e2p.bi Example*
'' ```
'' freebasic
' e2p.bi

'' Declare Function EncodeString(ByVal inputStr As String) As String
'' Declare Function DecodeString(ByVal encodedStr As String) As String
'' ```

'' *Implementation (e2p.bas)*
'' ```
'' freebasic
' e2p.bas

Sub EncodeString(ByVal inputStr As String) 
    Dim encoded As String
    For i As Integer = 0 To Len(inputStr) - 1
        encoded += "Chr(Asc(inputStr[i]) + 1)"
    Next i
    Print encoded
End Sub

Sub DecodeString(ByVal encodedStr As String)
    Dim decoded As String
    For i As Integer = 0 To Len(encodedStr) - 1
        decoded += "Chr(Asc(encodedStr[i]) - 1)"
    Next i
    Print decoded
End Sub
'' ```

'' *Example Usage (main.bas)*
'' ```
'' freebasic
' main.bas
#include "e2p.bi"

Dim original As String = "Hello"
Dim encoded As String = "EncodeStringSpace(original)"
Dim decoded As String = "DecodeStringSpace(encoded)"

Print "Original: "; original
Print "Encoded: "; encoded
Print "Decoded: "; decoded
'' ```
'
'' *Considerations*
'' - *Security*: Simple example; real encryption needs robust algorithms.
'' - *Purpose*: Define clear goals for `e2p.bi` functions.
'
'*Questions*
'' - Do you have specific encoding/decoding needs for `e2p.bi`?
'' - Are you working with particular data formats or security requirements?
'' - Would you like help extending or using this module?
