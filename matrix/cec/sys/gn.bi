'' *Creating gn.bi for Otologic Topics in FreeBASIC*
'' Let's explore creating a `gn.bi` module related to otologic topics, which pertain to the ear and hearing.

'' *gn.bi*
'' ```
'' freebasic
'' gn.bi

Type HearingTestResult
    frequency As Single
    threshold As Single
End Type

'' Declare Function CreateHearingTestResult(ByVal freq As Single, ByVal thresh As Single) As HearingTestResult
'' Declare Sub PrintHearingTestResult(ByRef result As HearingTestResult)
'' ```

'' *Implementation (gn.bas)*
'' ```
'' freebasic
''  gn.bas

Function CreateHearingTestResult(ByVal freq As Single, ByVal thresh As Single) As HearingTestResult
    Dim result As HearingTestResult
    result.frequency = freq
    result.threshold = thresh
    Return result
End Function

Sub PrintHearingTestResult(ByRef result As HearingTestResult)
    Print "Frequency: "; result.frequency; " Hz, Threshold: "; result.threshold; " dB"
End Sub
'' ```

'' *Example Usage (main.bas)*
'' ```
'' freebasic
' main.bas

Dim testResult As HearingTestResult
testResult = CreateHearingTestResult(1000, 20)
PrintHearingTestResult(testResult)
'' ```
'
''' *Possible Otologic Topics*
'' - *Audiometry*: Hearing tests measuring thresholds.
'' - *Hearing Loss*: Types (conductive, sensorineural).
'' - *Ear Anatomy*: Structures like cochlea, ossicles.
'
'' *Considerations*
'' - *Domain Specificity*: Otology involves medical/audiological concepts.
'' - *Data Representation*: Using types like `HearingTestResult`.
'
'' *Questions*
'' - Are you exploring otologic topics for a specific application?
'' - Do you want to model particular aspects of hearing or ear health?
'' - Would you like help extending or using this module?
