'' *Verifying Static References and Linear Equations in FreeBASIC*
'' Discussing linear equations and static references in FreeBASIC involves looking at how variables and equations are handled.

'' *Linear Equations Context*
'' - *Linear Equations*: Equations like `ax + by + cz = d` represent planes in 3D space (x, y, z).
'' - *Example*: `2x + 3y - z = 5` is a linear equation.

'' *FreeBASIC Aspects*
'' 1. *Variables*: FreeBASIC supports declaring variables for x, y, z.
'' 2. *Mathematical Operations*: Can perform calculations for linear equations.
'' ```
'' freebasic

' Example calculation
z = (d - a*x - b*y) / c
'' ```

'' *Static References*
'' - *Static Variables*: In FreeBASIC, `STATIC` keyword declares variables retaining value between calls.
''```
'' freebasic
Sub Example()
    Static counter As Integer
    counter += 1
    Print counter
End Sub
'' ```

'' *Linear Object Representation*
'' - *Structures*: FreeBASIC can use types for representing objects with x, y, z.
''```
'' freebasic
Type Point3D
    x As Single
    y As Single
    z As Single
End Type
Dim pt As Point3D
'' ```

'' *Questions*
'' - Are you working on a specific project involving linear equations or 3D points in FreeBASIC?
'' - Do you need help with implementing equations or data structures in FreeBASIC?
'' - Would you like examples of manipulating x, y, z data or solving linear systems?
